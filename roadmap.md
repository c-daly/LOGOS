## Vision

LOGOS aims to provide a robust foundation for **learning optimal agent-tool graphs**:  
Every agent and capability is modular, discoverable, and self-optimizing, supporting both simple and sophisticated deployments—from headless servers to fully embodied robots.

---

## Phase 1: Documentation & Architecture

- Create and maintain centralized architecture documentation
    - System overview, design principles, integration patterns
    - Initial diagrams and conceptual flowcharts
- Define API contracts and minimal component responsibilities
- Publish example configuration and deployment patterns
- Launch meta-repo as project’s “source of truth”

**Status:** _In Progress_

---

## Phase 2: Core System Prototypes

- Build minimal viable implementations of:
    - **Sophia:** Reasoning/orchestration agent with memory
    - **Apollo:** Expression/UI agent (face, panels, voice)
    - **Talos:** Embodiment/sensor agent (with mockable hardware interface)
- Establish inter-component registration and discovery mechanisms
- Demonstrate basic end-to-end flows (user input → reasoning → UI and/or embodiment)
- Provide simulation/dev environment (mock tools, headless mode)

---

## Phase 3: Evaluation & Adaptation

- Implement extensible evaluation modules (semantic critics, reward models)
- Integrate human feedback tools (real-time and asynchronous collection)
- Enable Sophia to critique, refine, and adapt her tool/agent usage
- Begin tracking user preferences and building memory-driven personalization
- Provide A/B testing harness for new evaluators, tools, and configurations

---

## Phase 4: Advanced Integrations

- Hardware-in-the-loop: Connect LOGOS to physical robots/devices
- Support for distributed or multi-agent deployments
- Advanced UI modules (web dashboard, VR, multiple Apollo instances)
- Richer feedback sources (physiological, multi-modal, external APIs)
- Early graph introspection/visualization tools

---

## Long-Term Directions

- Full-featured agent graph introspection and live debugging
- Plug-in marketplace for third-party tools, evaluators, and UIs
- Policy and constraint systems (security, privacy, access control)
- Support for learning optimal configurations across many users/devices
- Research into automatic graph structure adaptation (“meta-learning”)
- Community-driven documentation, tutorials, and integration guides

---

## How to Contribute

- Propose changes or features via GitHub issues or pull requests
- Suggest new integration patterns or tools
- Participate in roadmap discussions and planning
- Help write, edit, or review documentation
