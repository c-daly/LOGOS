# LOGOS Integration Patterns

LOGOS is architected for maximum flexibilityâ€”each major component (Sophia, Apollo, Talos) can be combined in different ways to suit the needs of your deployment.  
This document describes common integration patterns and sample topologies.

## Full-Stack Deployment

- **Components:** Sophia + Apollo + Talos (+ optional feedback tools)
- **Use case:** Full embodied AI robot or assistant with reasoning, real-world sensors/actuators, and a multimodal UI.
- **Pattern:**
    - User interacts with Apollo (face, panels, voice, etc.)
    - Apollo relays input to Sophia, who plans and reasons.
    - Sophia queries Talos for world state or acts via actuators.
    - Sophia sends responses to Apollo for rendering.
    - Human feedback tools may collect ratings/comments.

---

## Headless/Server Deployment

- **Components:** Sophia + Talos
- **Use case:** Robotics backends, IoT, or headless bots; no UI, only embodiment and reasoning.
- **Pattern:**
    - User interacts via API/CLI.
    - Sophia controls Talos for sensing and action.
    - No face or UI; results delivered as API responses or logs.

---

## Simulation/Virtual Deployment

- **Components:** Sophia + Apollo (+ mock Talos)
- **Use case:** Dev, research, simulation, or environments where no physical hardware is present.
- **Pattern:**
    - Apollo provides simulated UI and (optionally) simulated sensor data.
    - Talos can be replaced by a mock for development/testing.
    - Great for running end-to-end demos without hardware.

---

## API-Only Deployment

- **Components:** Sophia (standalone)
- **Use case:** Text-only chatbots, backend agents, or integration with other systems.
- **Pattern:**
    - User interacts via CLI, REST, or messaging.
    - All embodiment and UI capabilities are omitted.

---

## Custom/Research Deployments

- LOGOS supports **arbitrary agent-tool graphs**.  
- Example: Multiple Talos embodiments, distributed Sophia instances, or custom UI modules.
- For research, you can plug in evaluators, data loggers, or new toolchains without modifying the core system.

---

## Component Integration Guidelines

- **Registration:** Components must register with Sophia (or a registry module) at startup.
- **Discovery:** Sophia interrogates the current graph to determine available tools, sensors, actuators, and feedback sources.
- **Communication:** All communication is via well-defined APIs (REST, message passing, RPC, etc.).
- **Substitution:** Components may be omitted or swapped for mocks/stubs; Sophia adapts based on the current system graph.

---

## Extending with Additional Tools/Agents

- LOGOS is designed for easy extension:
    - Add new tools (e.g., a new sensor or data source)
    - Add new evaluators/critics (e.g., for user engagement, performance)
    - Add new UIs (web, VR, physical panels, etc.)
    - Plug-in architecture means new modules can be dropped in without major refactoring.
