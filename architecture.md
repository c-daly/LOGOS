# LOGOS Architecture

**Learning Optimal G\* Of Systems**

LOGOS is a modular, adaptive platform for building intelligent agents and robots. Its core philosophy is that every deployment is a dynamic, composable graph of agents and tools—optimized for the needs of its users.

## Vision

LOGOS provides a foundation for **adaptive, human-centered, and self-improving agent systems**.  
At its heart is a dynamic *graph* of agents and tools—where reasoning, embodiment, and expression are modular, composable, and optimized for each deployment context.

## Core Components

### Sophia (Reasoning/Orchestration)

- **Role:** Central orchestrator and meta-reasoner.
- **Responsibilities:**
    - Interrogates available tools and agents.
    - Selects and sequences actions.
    - Critiques and refines her own strategies.
    - Maintains memory and adapts to user preferences.

### Apollo (Expression/UI)

- **Role:** Multimodal user interface and expression agent.
- **Responsibilities:**
    - Renders Sophia’s outputs (face, panels, speech, etc).
    - Collects user input (text, voice, feedback).
    - May be omitted for headless or API-only deployments.

### Talos (Embodiment/Sensors)

- **Role:** Interface to physical world: sensors and actuators.
- **Responsibilities:**
    - Provides real-time sensor data (audio, video, lidar, etc).
    - Executes actuator commands (motors, lights, etc).
    - May be omitted for simulation or pure virtual agents.

---

## Agent-Tool Graph Model

- **LOGOS is not a pipeline or static module stack.**
- Every system instance forms a *graph*:
    - **Nodes:** Agents (Sophia, Apollo, Talos, sub-agents), tools, sensors, actuators, evaluation modules, feedback collectors, etc.
    - **Edges:** API calls, data flows, command delegation.
- **Dynamic:** Components may be present or absent; the system graph adapts accordingly.

---

## Modularity and Optionality

- Each major component (Sophia, Apollo, Talos) is **optional** and can be swapped, replaced, or omitted.
- New agents, tools, or feedback mechanisms are “plug-and-play” nodes in the graph.
- Deployment can range from full-robotic embodiment to minimal CLI-only setups.

---

## Human Feedback as a Tool

- **Human reaction data (ratings, comments, physiological signals, etc.) is collected by modular tools.**
- Feedback is recorded to a database/log, decoupled from agent execution.
- Evaluation modules may consume this data in real time or asynchronously to guide adaptation and self-critique.

---

## Adaptation and Evaluation

- **Sophia’s core value:**  
    She interrogates, applies, critiques, and refines her capabilities—using internal evaluation models, semantic analysis, and (optionally) human feedback.
- Evaluation modules can use:
    - Human ratings
    - Semantic alignment metrics
    - Engagement or task-completion signals
    - Clustering, similarity, or other ML models
- The goal is not endless meta-analysis, but meaningful adaptation to user goals and context.

---

## Integration Patterns

- **Full deployment:** Sophia + Apollo + Talos (with optional feedback tool).
- **Headless:** Sophia + Talos (no UI/face).
- **Virtual/sim:** Sophia + Apollo (mock sensors/actuators).
- **API only:** Sophia standalone (API/CLI).

A central “meta-repo” (LOGOS) provides architecture docs, diagrams, and integration examples for all patterns.

---

## Design Principles

- **Modularity:** All major capabilities are independent and swappable.
- **Composability:** Every deployment is a graph, not a chain—enables dynamic adaptation.
- **User-Centric Adaptation:** Memory and feedback loops are always anchored in user needs, not endless self-analysis.
- **Extensibility:** New tools, evaluators, or feedback mechanisms can be added at any time.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Feedback collection, evaluation, and adaptation are decoupled.

---

## Future Directions

- Tooling for graph introspection and visualization.
- More sophisticated meta-reasoning and self-critique models.
- Richer multi-modal feedback (voice, video, physiological, etc.).
- Support for distributed/decentralized agent graphs.
